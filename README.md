# Quantum Metric Tensor
A version of the Wolfram Mathematica code used in my PhD project to compute the Quantum Metric Tensor, its determinant, and its scalar curvature for the anisotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.

The default value of the pseudospin is j=20. First compute the three components of the QMT using the G11.nb notebook, then, run Determinant.nb and, finally, run R.nb to find the Ricci scalar.
